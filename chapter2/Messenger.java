/**
   A class that represents a Messenger which is passed an object of
   type E (by a Transmitter) and holds it until it is requested (by a
   Receiver). Note that further attempts by a thread to give the
   messenger an object while it holds one are made to wait, and
   attempts by a thread to obtain the object while the messenger does
   not hold one are made to wait.
