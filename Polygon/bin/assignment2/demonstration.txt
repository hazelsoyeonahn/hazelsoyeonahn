This algorithm is made by my self Hazel Ahn. For this project, I have implements for a week of time.

	1.	Brute-Force-Approach that finds all possible combination of edge lines. Then remove the duplicates. 
	2.	Greedy Approach that uses existing Brute Force Approach to find all possible combination of edge lines then print out the minimum total lengths of edge lines. 
	3.	Exact Approach that check whether the minimum total length of edge lines is accurate by using divide and conquer technique with exacting greedy class.
